After initial frustration of trying to find a FAST way to get this resolved (ASOS no phone number and a chat box that kept disappearing unless you were like lightning on keyboard?), I liaised with Donique who resolved this quickly, re-ordering to be delivered within 4 working days.  This has minimized my delivery anxiety, as it is a present for my daughter.  Friendly and efficient service overall and providing it arrives (it was confirmed it was in stock) with watch inside(!), I will be a happy customer again. Sad state of affairs, that people (presumably at packing stage) steal, when the rest of us work hard to earn money to buy these treats.
