9,"Ordered a Vivienne Westwood which was delivered on time but  arrived sealed but with no watch inside!  Christmas stress!  After initial frustration of trying to find a FAST way to get this resolved (ASOS no phone number and a chat box that kept disappearing unless you were like lightning on keyboard?), I liaised with Donique who resolved this quickly, re-ordering to be delivered within 4 working days.  This has minimized my delivery anxiety, as it is a present for my daughter.  Friendly and efficient service overall and providing it arrives (it was confirmed it was in stock) with watch inside(!), I will be a happy customer again. Sad state of affairs, that people (presumably at packing stage) steal, when the rest of us work hard to earn money to buy these treats. ASOS so far, so good!",Positive," I ordered a watch from ASOS, but it arrived without the watch inside."," Westwood, ASOS, Donique",Thank you for your review.
